### Assignment Description

Make a servo rotate 180 degrees using VS code

### Evidence

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here. The diagram should be clear enough that I can recreate the wiring from scratch. 

### Code
import time
import board
import pwmio
from adafruit_motor import servo

### create a PWMOut object on Pin A2.
pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.A1, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)

### Create a servo object, my_servo.
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

while True:
    for angle in range(0, 180, 5):  # 0 - 180 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)
    for angle in range(180, 0, -5): # 180 - 0 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)

### Reflection

Make sure you have the most recent librarys or it wont work also if your getting errors related to PINs change it to a different analog pin before you look elsewhere.

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
